          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Reality of me </h2>
          <p align="justify"> Yes I write randomly. Mostly when I’m overwhelmed from a lot. However I’ve never really written about myself and writing about myself is a bit new to me. So this won’t be flawless but I’ll try to make it as interesting and brief as possible. Hey everyone my name is Amina, I’m a 300 level student of Nile University. A 19 year old still trying to figure her life out. I take pride in my sense of humor and I’ll like to call myself an ambivert, contrary to popular opinion that I am an introvert.  I’m a very conservative person. I enjoy my company and will rather be on my own. Probably because I don’t do too well when I’m uncomfortable. However I can be the loudest person in the room the moment I get comfortable. I can be pretty outgoing and social as well. I guess can say there is a balance in my personality.
Growing up as the last child of my parents really did a lot to me. I was highly protected by both my parents and siblings and I got practically everything done for me growing up to be very fragile. Although I was exposed I had no experience with life.

          </p>

    <p align="justify">  Since I turned 18, adulthood and University has been taking its toll on me and life hasn’t been too smooth sometime I feel devastated and without direction but Alhamdulillah regardless. I’ve learnt a lot at a pretty young age. I’ve met a lot of people and lost a lot as well, both have taught me it isn’t how long a relationship is but how true it is. I’ve had very hard days, days I’ve contemplated my purpose of existence, days I’ve been so close to giving up, days I’ve cried myself to sleep because It was too much to handle. From school work to personal relationships. </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But things are different now. I’ve come to peace with the fact that everything can’t be perfect. In fact perfection needs imperfection to be perfect. I won’t say I’ve gotten to the best with my religion but I can say I’m better with it I’ve learnt to express my pain and stress through writing. I’m also not as good as I want to be with writing but I’m giving it my best shot.
  I’m gonna stop here for now and I’ll try to update in my free time.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Finding my hobbies</h2>
          <p>At a point I was convinced I had passion for nothing. And I concluded I was not serious with my life. But with time I figured I find a lot of things interesting but also not enough to be obsessed with so I live on vibes basically. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> In secondary school I enjoyed playing basketball and table tennis. I haven’t played those since 2019 I doubt I would enjoy playing those again.  </li>
            <li> I learnt how to bake during the lockdown and now bake when I’m bored or when I need to keep my mind busy  </li>
            <li> i think i can say writing is my latest hobby, i read to kill boredom and write when i'm overwhelmed </li>
            <li> Lately i've been enjoying photography. Taking pictures and editing is quite interesting</li>
